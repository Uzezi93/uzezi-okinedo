# Welcome to my website

My name is Uzezi Okinedo, I am a Biology Ph.D. candidate in Moyers lab at UMass Boston. My research area is in plant genomics and evolutionary biology. I employ computational genomics approaches, computer vision strategies, and evolutionary models to answer questions on how plants thrive in different environments and to understand the genetic basis of trait variation. I use this information to identify plant types that can be harnessed for conservation purposes or selective breeding.
