### Research Interests
I employ a variety of tools to explore my research, including:
- **Computational Genomics**: Understanding the genetic basis of trait variation.
- **Computer Vision Strategies**: Leveraging advanced image analysis techniques for plant phenotyping.
- **Evolutionary Models**: Investigating how plants adapt to diverse environments.

### Applications
My work identifies plant types that can:
- Be harnessed for **conservation purposes**.
- Aid **selective breeding** for agriculture and sustainability.
